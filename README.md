## Overview
文法Gemini is a full stack project using Google's Gemini AI for the MHacks x Google hackathon. It allows users to practice their Japanese Grammer in conversation by prompting the user to incorporate various grammar points while understanding and comprehending what the chat bot is outputting.

After a user has responded, the chatbot grades the reponse, suggests other grammatically correct ways the user could've responded, and asks another question to continue the conversation.
