Bear with me, I'm trying to make this work ðŸ˜”

# Project Goals 
- [x] Created Flask REST API for backend
- [ ] Configured API for Google Gemni
- [ ] Start front end??
- [ ] TBC

## Technologies used
- Frontend
    - Next.js -> Creates high quality applications with React components with server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), or client-side rendering (CSR).
    - React.js -> I mean... it's React
    - ESLint -> static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns or code that doesn't adhere to coding standards in JavaScript codebases. 
    - TailwindCSS -> enables rapid and efficient UI development by providing a utility-first approach to styling, allowing developers to build responsive and customizable designs with minimal CSS code.
    - Typescript ->  enhance JavaScript projects with static typing, enabling early error detection, improved code maintainability, and enhanced developer productivity through better tooling and code documentation.

- Backend
    - Python Flask -> RESTFul API support
    - Flask CORS ->  to enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in Flask applications, allowing them to accept requests from web clients served from different domains

# Web app coming soon (ï¾‰â—•ãƒ®â—•)ï¾‰*:ï½¥ï¾Ÿâœ§

Next.js Documentation
=====================
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
